# Infectious-Disease-Surveillance

## General info
This project is about How Infectious Disease Surveillance works in India.
For this project, I have gathered the data taking reference from:
1) Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (https://idsp.nic.in/)
2) https://www.kaggle.com/haithemhermessi/infectious-disease-prediction

## Prerequisite:
To run the code, you need to have the following:
* Python (More Details: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Jupyter (More Details: https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

## Running the code locally:
* Navigate to Infectious-Disease-Surveillance_Udacity.ipynb
* Download this file to your local computer by right-clicking on Raw button -> Save link as... 
* Select a location from the dialog-box and save it. Now open this using Jupyter and start the Kernel

## Takeaways:
There are 3 real-world context answered in this project:
1) What is the current Infectious Disease trend across the year ?
2) What is the current Density of Diseases in each location per year ?
3) What is the current total Disease Count per location ?

And then using Machine Learning, we tried to predict for any outbreak of diseases.

## Extras:
I have also added the .csv file which is used for analysis.
