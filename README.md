# Infectious-Disease-Surveillance

## General info
This project is about How Infectious Disease Surveillance works in India.
For this project, I have gathered the data taking reference from:
1) Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (https://idsp.nic.in/)
2) https://www.kaggle.com/haithemhermessi/infectious-disease-prediction

## Prerequisite:
To run the code, you need to have the following:
* Python (More Details: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Jupyter (More Details: https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

## Running the code locally:
* Navigate to Infectious-Disease-Surveillance_Udacity.ipynb
* Download this file to your local computer by right-clicking on Raw button -> Save link as... 
* Select a location from the dialog-box and save it. Now open this using Jupyter and start the Kernel

## Libraries used in the project:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Math
* LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model
* R2_score from sklearn.metrics
* matplotlib.pyplot

## Takeaways:
There are 3 real-world context answered in this project:
1) What is the current Infectious Disease trend across the year ?
2) What is the current Density of Diseases in each location per year ?
3) What is the current total Disease Count per location ?

And then using Machine Learning, we tried to predict for any outbreak of diseases.

Disease prediction has the potential to benefit stakeholders such as National Health Programs and the government.
It can identify patients at risk of disease or health conditions. Clinicians can then take appropriate measures to
avoid or minimize the risk and in turn, improve quality of care and avoid potential hospital admissions.

In our analysis, we tried to implement functionalities of machine learning in healthcare in a single system. 
Instead of diagnosis, when a disease prediction is implemented using certain machine learning predictive algorithms then healthcare can be made smart.

## Extras:
I have also added the .csv file which is used for analysis.
